tUPLonebody.py is the final result of this project, with an integration of n-body and k-means. The experiments were conducted on this file. As this is python2, the
following command can be used:
python tUPLonebody.py <input-file> <years of simulation>
python tUPLonebody.py 3_body.dat 1
A "output_data" folder should be available in the same folder as tUPLonebody.py

tuplnbodyRewrite.py is an interim result of our project before k-means was implemented. This can be used as example where there are more than one conditions.

directsum tupl onebody.txt is the tUPL specification of tUPLonebody.py. Not all initialization is shown in this specification.

The .dat files are starting points containing different systems. A lot of other .dat files are available in the git repository where they came from:

plot.p is the plotting tool that was available in the fortran project, it can be used by following the instructions that came with the tool:
These data can then be visualised using the gnuplot script `plot.p`, which can do either a static or animated plot. This script can be run by entering 
gnuplot `>gnuplot` and then type `gnuplot> load 'plot.p'`. The script requires some things to be specified that are listed in each plotting file; 
things like number of particles, dimension for the plot.
